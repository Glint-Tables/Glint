# Glint

Welcome to Glint!

Glint is a responsive table generation API for Laravel. The inspiration of the project began with us using Filament for a project. After running in repeated technical and performance issues with filament, we decided to create our own baggage-free DataTable engine. If you've used Filament, you will recognize most of the API. We tried to stick close to what we were familiar with simply for our own developer experience.

Glint is definitely a work in progress, so if you have an suggestions, feel free to email the maintainers, Ben or AJ, or open a pull request. If you've used Glint for your project, let us know what you think!
